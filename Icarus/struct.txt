    seccond stage:
        main parts:
            bliss   (EXE)   download and run Iron_man
            Iron_man(DLL)   jumper to STRONTIUM [+]
            APT_C_36(DLL)   is the lib for priv esclation
            STRONTIUM(EXE) this is the PL4 download, admin, exclusion in oder admin, exclusion, download (base64 the exclusion step) [+][-]

            1MB max (bliss)
            no constraint (Iron_man & APT_C_36)
        
        :purpous
            to download and run PL3
        
        :resion
            it can be written in C, C++, or C# now so not as tight constraintes 

    there will now be no more constraint on file size

    PL3:

        downloads PL4 Icarus

    PL4:

        main parts:

            Icarus  (exe)   
            burout  (DLL)   [will the shell for reverse TCP shell]
            Rome    (sys)   [cant use c# and prob not C++ should use C]

        :purpous

            Icarus:
                put itself as start as system (MABYE do Trusted installer trick)
                get system priv and (not dicided yet) Trusted installer
                downloads Rome and burout 
                will establish a reverse TCP shell and will use burout to interpret the commands
                get Rome to Start-Boot (make a chesk for start-Boot frist)
            
            burout:

                shell for Icarus (if rome is in boot-start run thrugh Rome)
                holds built in commands (passer to the command line or powershell or Download command for more payloads)
            
            Rome:

                find a way to get a shell (prob full custom and more restrited than reg)(but can make cutom syscalls for Direct hardware access, 
                Read/write physical memory, Register interrupt handlers, Load privileged code, Can crash entire OS)
